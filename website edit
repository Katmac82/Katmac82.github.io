Hi Saul, 

Sorry it has taken me so long to post the edits I would like to make to my clients website, but here they are! 

1. (most important) Make the site live.  The fitness website that is currently in use is through wordpress. 

2. Make sure that the site is visible on all browsers (even old ones)

3. Eventually I would like to work on the hover effect of the graphics.  

Thank you and sorry again that this took so long.  

Katie
