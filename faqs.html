	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</section>

<section class="faq">
	<h4>What is pole fitness?</h4>
		<p> Pole dancing is a form of performing arts, a combination of dance and gymnastics.  It involves dancing and performing acrobatic tricks with a vertical pole and is an increasingly popular form of fitness practiced by many enthusiasts in gyms, studios and homes around the world.</p>
		<h4>What is Lyra?</h4>
		<p> Lyra, or aerial hoop, is a circular steel apparatus resembling a hula-hoop that is suspended from the ceiling on which students perform aerial acrobatics. The hoop sometimes has a hand loop and a bar across the top. It can be used static, spinning, or swinging.  LOVE Pole Fitness has lyra in a variety of sizes to fit the comfort and height of each student.</p>
	<h4>I have never danced or worked out before, will I be able to participate and keep up in class?</h4>
		<p>Yes!  Classes are broken down into multiple levels to meet each studentâ€™s ability and experience level. Students can advance as they safely build muscle and skill.  Many classes on our schedule welcome students of all levels.</p>
	<h4>Can I bring a friend or guest?</h4>
		<p>No. Guests or friends are not allowed in the studio while class is in session due to the confidentiality of our students. If your friends are interested, encourage them to speak with an instructor/owner about how to sign up for their first class! </p>
	<h4>Who attends classes?</h4>
		<p>Women of all ages, backgrounds, professions, and fitness levels attend classes. Men are welcome to attend Open Pole.  Male students who are interested in any other classes on the schedule should speak with an instructor. Students under 18 can attend Pee Wee Polers.
		</p>
	<h4>What should I wear to class? What should I bring?</h4>
		<p>In general, comfortable workout clothes are required.  Form fitting tanks and shorts are best.  Most classes are done in bare feet. For Pole Dance classes, heels are encouraged, but not required.  For Lyra and Floorwork &amp; Transitions, leggings, legwarmers, and kneepads are helpful, but not required. 

			<p>Do not wear rings, bracelets, and other jewelry.  Do not wear any type of hand cream or body lotion, as doing so creates a slippery film that makes gripping the pole difficult.  Poles are cleaned with rubbing alcohol after each use.</p>

			<p>Bring water and a positive attitude.  We have rubbing alcohol, mats, all natural mat cleaner, and clean towels on hand for you.</p>

	<h4>What if I am shy?</h4>
		<p>You'll feel right at home at LOVE Pole Fitness! Our instructors and staff are friendly and supportive.  Our lights are dimmed during class to help set the mood. Expect to laugh, have fun, and make new friends! To be sensual and sassy, you don't need to be serious. Just have fun! We also offer one-on-one classes if you would like a more private setting.</p>
	<h4> What if I miss a class?</h4>
		<p> Missed classes can not be made up if no cancellation notice is given.  If a student contacts LOVE at least 24 hours prior to scheduled class, the class can be made up withing the 2 weeks succeeding the missed class.  Students are allowed only 1 make up class per 4 week session. Cancellations without notice will result in a $25 cancellation fee.</p>
	<h4>How do I redeem my Groupon?</h4>
