	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</section>

<section class="faq">
	<h4>What is pole fitness?</h4>
		<p> Pole dancing is a form of performing arts, a combination of dance and gymnastics.  It involves dancing and performing acrobatic tricks with a vertical pole and is an increasingly popular form of fitness practiced by many enthusiasts in gyms, studios and homes around the world.</p>
	<h4>I have never danced or worked out before, will I be able to participate and keep up in class?</h4>
		<p>Yes! Chair, belly dancing, and hooping classes are great for any student of any experience level.  Pole fitness classes  are broken down into multiple levels to meet each students ability and experience level.  Students have the ability to advance  as they build muscle and skill safely.</p>
	<h4>Can I bring a friend/guest?</h4>
		<p>No guests or friends are allowed in the studio while class is in session due to the confidentiality of our students.  Friends and guests are encouraged to visit the studio before or after classes, and can absolutely sign up for a class or do a drop-in class if there is an available spot.</p>
	<h4>Who attends classes?</h4>
		<p>Young Women, Mature Women; women from all walks of life, the only prerequisite is that you are over 18 and want to have lots of fun.</p>
	<h4>Are men allowed in the studio?</h4>
		<p>Yes, we have some Co-ed classes offered throughout the week. Please check the schedule to find days and times.</p>
	<h4>What should I wear to class?</h4>
		<p>Comfortable workout clothes are required for class. Tanks and shorts are best, but t-shirts and yoga pants may also be worn.  We encourage students to wear high heels to extend the workout, but they are not required. Sneakers and bare feet are also allowed.</p>
	<h4>What should I be aware of?</h4>
		<p>Do not wear rings or bracelets. And do not wear any type of hand cream or body lotion. These are a huge NO NO. The reasoning is that they create a &quot;film&quot; between you and the pole, thus causing less grip for you. What&apos;s more, the chemicals and oils they contain stay on the pole long after you have left it. We do have rubbing alcohol to help cut down on this, but for your own grip and safety too, refrain from creams and lotions before pole class.</p>
	<h4>What if I am shy?</h4>
		<p>You&apos;ll feel right at home. Our instructors and staff will make you feel comfortable. Our lights are dimmed during class to help set the mood. We have so much fun, we&apos;re laughing and having such an amazing time moving to the music that you will forget where you are. To be sensual and sassy you don&apos;t need to be serious, just have fun!! We also offer one-on-one classes for those of you that would like a more private setting.</p>
	<h4> What if I miss a class?</h4>
		<p> Missed classes can not be made up if no cancellation notice is given.  If a student contacts LOVE at least 24 hours prior to scheduled class, the class can be made up withing the 2 weeks succeeding the missed class.  Students are allowed only 1 make up class per 4 week session. Cancellations without notice will result in a $25 cancellation fee.</p>
