<article class="sierra">
	<h2>Sierra</h2>
		<p>Sierra, aka LOVE Bunny started taking pole classes at LOVE in August of 2012.  She had never taken dance, gymnastics, cheerleading or any other sport at all, but after her very first class she was hooked. It wasn’t so much the dancing or performance part that she was drawn to either. She fell in love with the sisterhood, having a sanctuary full of beautiful, strong and encouraging women, a place where she could feel comfortable with her body and learn how to own it.</p>
		<p> Just a year after beginning pole she competed in her first real pole competition at Supershag 2013 in Boston and again in 2014. Around January/February 2014 she was first introduced to lyra (aerial hoop) and she was fascinated by it. Thanks to the skills and strength she had previously gained from pole, lyra came very easy for her and she couldn’t get enough!</p>
		<p> She began teaching lyra and pole classes at LOVE in May of 2014 and in July of she got her Lyra Certification.  In November 2014 she competed in the first lyra competition to come to Boston thanks to Pole Sport Organization where she placed second and one of her very own student placed first! To her, that’s the best part about teaching, watching her students’ progress and learns to fly. They set goals that for some people seem impossible to reach, and she gets to watch them surpass those goals every week.</p>
