	<article class="sierra">
	<h2>Sierra (Owner)</h2>
		<p>Sierra, aka LOVE Bunny started taking pole classes at LOVE in August of 2012.  She had never taken dance, gymnastics, cheerleading or any other sport at all, but after her very first class she was hooked. It wasn&apos;t so much the dancing or performance part that she was drawn to either. She fell in love with the sisterhood, having a sanctuary full of beautiful, strong and encouraging women, it was a place where she could feel comfortable with her body and learn how to own it.</p>
		<p> Just a year after beginning pole she competed in her first real pole competition at Supershag 2013 in Boston and again in 2014. Around January/February 2014 she was first introduced to lyra (aerial hoop) and she was fascinated by it. Thanks to the skills and strength she had previously gained from pole, lyra came very easy for her and she couldn’t get enough!</p>
		<p> She began teaching lyra and pole classes at LOVE in May of 2014 and in July of she got her Lyra Certification.  In November 2014 she competed in the first lyra competition to come to Boston thanks to Pole Sport Organization where she placed second and one of her very own student placed first! To her, that&apos;s the best part about teaching, watching her students’ progress and learns to fly. They set goals that for some people seem impossible to reach, and she gets to watch them surpass those goals every week.</p>

<article class="lindsey">
	<h2>Lindsey</h2>
	<p>I&apos;m Lindsey Daniels, full time art director and designer who dabbles in makeup artistry. I have been practicing pole for 3 years, and found Lyra in early 2013 while attempting to lose weight and get healthy. I was hooked from the very first class! By the end of that year I had met my weight loss goal, won my first metal in Lyra, and found a whole new level of confidence! I&apos;ve just started teaching Lyra in 2015 and have been loving it as I struggled when I first entered the apparatus, and find love connecting with students and watching them grow.</p>
	<p>I&apos;ve always been a creative person, always crafting, painting, singing, writing, playing with makeup, and making costumes...aerial arts felt like the next level of embracing my love of all things creative.</p>

		<li>1st Place Winner Lyra Level 1 Division North East Aerial Arts 2014</li>
		<li>1st Place Winner Lyra Level 2 Division Atlantic Pole Championships 2015</li>

<article class="sara">
	<h2>Sara</h2>
	<p>In October of 2013, Sara tried pole fitness on a whim.  Her very first class was at LPF, and it was love at first spin!  Sara loves pole not only for the physical and emotional benefits, but also for the glittery platform shoes and powerful heel clacks, which should never be done in moderation.  After just one year of poling, Sara entered the 2014 Northeast Aerial Arts Championships (NEAAC) and placed first in the Level 2 Dramatic Senior category.  She leveled up in 2015, placing 5th of 11th at the 2015 NEAAC in the Level 3 Dramatic Senior category.  Sara completed her X-Pert Pole Fitness Level 1 &amp; 2 Instructor Training in November 2014.  Her pole idols are Alethea Austin and Cleo the Hurricane.</p>
