	<h2>Sierra (Owner)</h2>
		<p>Sierra, a/k/a LOVE Bunny, started taking pole classes at LOVE in August of 2012. She had never taken dance, gymnastics, cheerleading, or any other sport, but after her very first class, she was hooked. It wasn't so much the dancing or performance part that she was drawn to, but the sisterhood.  Having a sanctuary full of beautiful, strong and encouraging women, Sierra found she could feel comfortable with her body and learn how to own it. Shortly after, she found lyra (aerial hoop) and was fascinated by it. </p>
		<p> Sierra entered her first pole competition at Supershag 2013 in Boston and again in 2014.  She got her Lyra Certification in July of 2014.  Sierra competed in the first lyra competition to come to Boston, thanks to Pole Sport Organization, where she placed second, and one of her very own students placed first! To her, that's the best part about teaching: watching her students surpass their own goals as they learn to fly.

<article class="lindsey">
	<h2>Lindsey</h2>
	<p>Lindsey is a full time art director and designer who dabbles in makeup artistry. She has been practicing pole since 2012 and found lyra in early 2013 while attempting to lose weight and get healthy. She was hooked from the very first class! By the end of that year, Lindsey had met her weight loss goal, won her first medal in lyra, and found a whole new level of confidence. She began teaching lyra in 2015 and loves connecting with beginner students and watching them grow.  Aerial arts, for Lindsey, is the next level of embracing her love of all things creative.  She took first place in Lyra Level 1 at Northeast Aerial Arts in 2014 and first place in Lyra Level 2 at Atlantic Pole Championships in 2015.</p>

<article class="sara">
	<h2>Sara</h2>
	<p>In October of 2013, Sara tried pole fitness on a whim.  Her very first class was at LPF, and it was love at first spin!  Sara loves pole not only for the physical and emotional benefits, but also for the glittery platform shoes and powerful heel clacks, which should never be done in moderation.  After just one year of poling, Sara entered the 2014 Northeast Aerial Arts Championships (NEAAC) and placed first in the Level 2 Dramatic Senior category.  She leveled up in 2015, placing 5th of 11th at the 2015 NEAAC in the Level 3 Dramatic Senior category.  Sara completed her X-Pert Pole Fitness Level 1 &amp; 2 Instructor Training in November 2014.  Her pole idols are Alethea Austin and Cleo the Hurricane.</p>
